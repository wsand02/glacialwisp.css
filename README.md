# GlacialWisp.css

## A slightly modified version of Spectre.css

GlacialWisp.css is a fork of Spectre.css, a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework, originally made by [Yan Zhu](https://github.com/picturepan2). Which I have modified for my own endeavors.

## Getting started

There are 2 ways to get started with Glacial Wisp CSS framework in your projects. You can either manually install or use NPM, Yarn and Bower.

### Install manually
Download the compiled and minified [Glacial Wisp CSS files](https://github.com/wsand02/glacialwisp.css/tree/master/docs/dist). And include `glacialwisp.min.css` located in `/dist` in your website or Web app &lt;head&gt; part.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="glacialwisp.min.css">`

### Install with NPM
`$ npm i glacialwisp.css`
