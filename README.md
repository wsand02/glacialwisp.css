## A slightly modified version of Spectre.css

Spectre.css is a lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework, originally made by [Yan Zhu](https://github.com/picturepan2). Which I have modified for my own endeavors.

- Lightweight (~10KB gzipped) starting point for your projects
- Flexbox-based, responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Elegantly designed and developed elements and components

Spectre is a side project based on years of CSS development work on a large web service project. Spectre only includes modern base styles, responsive layout system, CSS components and utilities, and it can be modified for your project with Sass/Scss compiler.

## Getting started

There are 5 ways to get started with Spectre CSS framework in your projects. You can either manually install or use NPM, Yarn and Bower.

### Install manually
Download the compiled and minified [Spectre CSS files](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre/tree/master/docs/dist). And include `spectre.css` located in `/docs/dist` in your website or Web app &lt;head&gt; part.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="spectre.min.css">`

### Install with NPM
`$ npm i github:wsand02/spectre`
